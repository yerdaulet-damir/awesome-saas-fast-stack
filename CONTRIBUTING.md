Thanks for improving the stack! Two ways to help:

## 1) Suggest a tool
- Open an issue using **Tool Suggestion**
- Include: name, URL, category, why it's useful, free-tier notes

## 2) Send a PR
- Update `data/tools.json` (keep alphabetical order within categories)
- Run link checks (GitHub Action will validate)
- Keep descriptions neutral; no affiliate links

Quality bar:
- Free tier or generous trial
- Speeds up building/automation/growth
- Widely useful (not super niche)
